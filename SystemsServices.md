## Open Questions Re Next Steps for Prototyping Horizontal Technical Overlay

Rather than deep prototype, the questions now are higher level such as "Where do tokens go" and "how tokens generated" and "what is the role and function of the authorization service provider(s)" etc.  

More subtle still, strategic technical evaluation is needed on general approach issues such as "which protocol, standards, flows and integration patterns are appropriate for the size, sophistication level of the likely initial partner base and provide a graceful path for adoption for the likely second phase adopters?" and "in what way can OpenID Connect be leveraged without getting too far ahead of general current market conditions" and "how could more suitable but less mature approaches such as BlueButtonPlus,  RHEx and UMA be selectively adopted to achieve the best balance of capability and power while retaining boring and safe paths for day to day business process, operations and service path reliability" etc"
