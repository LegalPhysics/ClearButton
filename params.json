{"name":"ClearButton.Net: Developing a Personal Data Notice Registry ","tagline":"Repository for the ClearButton project of the MIT Human Dynamics Lab LegalPhysics research team.","body":"# Project Launch\r\n\r\n**Overview, context and videos about the ClearButton initiative is available at our:**\r\n\r\n## [Project Launch Blog Post](http://www.ecitizen.tv/2014/01/clearbutton-personal-data-notice.html)\r\n\r\nClearButton is a initiative of the MIT Media Lab [Human Dynamics](http://hd.media.mit.edu) group legal research team.  ClearButton as a prototype of the [Computation Legal Science](http://www.ecitizen.tv/2014/01/computational-legal-science.html) research and development agenda of the legal research team.  \r\n\r\n# Personal Data Notice Registry\r\n\r\n* A simple registry service can provide the means for people to register their request to know who has what personal data about them.  \r\n\r\n* Organizations holding personal data can use the registry to discover and notify people who registered their request.  \r\n\r\nThe ClearButton initiative aims to develop an open architecture, open standards and open source reference implementation this personal data notice registry and related services.  \r\n\r\n# ClearButton: A New Deal on Data\r\n\r\n* Develop value proposition and system experience for a) disclosing organizations, b) registered individuals and c) service providers; \r\n\r\n* Develop business, legal and technical aspects of the system from the 3 key vantages; and\r\n\r\n* Prototype, test & adapt for use and scaling.\r\n\r\n# Implications of ClearButton Method:\r\n\r\nBy providing a direct method and mechanism for the request by, transmission to, receipt of and links for personal data disclosures, ClearButton also serves as a basis for many new sources of value.  The metadata alone, in aggregate and anonymized form, generated from a wide-scale use of a personal data notice register would be so valuable that it alone could fund operations and generate significant new value. \r\n\r\n# The ClearButton system flow enables:\r\n\r\n* Individuals to learn how they stand in the big group of people… are they getting the same treatment, missing opportunities or suffering from inaccurate data flowing about them?\r\n\r\n* Organizations to gain a valid, uniform and up to date point of contact for business communications while avoiding paper mailings.\r\n\r\n# FutureScape\r\n\r\n* Use the registry to ask for changes - to be removed from lists or databases, or to correct or update your data.\r\n\r\n* Use registry identity as a buffer to login or form future accounts and relations.\r\n\r\n* Agree to more deals and revoke agreements in an open, enforceable environment. \r\n\r\n# Individuals Value Vantage:\r\n\r\n* Find out who has what personal data about you.\r\n\r\n* Have a way to request that data.\r\n\r\n* Learn how the holders of your personal data received it (and from whom) and to whom it has been disclosed. \r\n\r\n* First step in getting control over your data.\r\n\r\n# Service Providers Value Vantage:\r\n\r\n[Under development:  Operate service (personal data notice registry) creating directly value for individuals and organizations.  Create standardized solution for multiple organizations, in both private and governmental context.]\r\n\r\n# Organizations Value Vantage:\r\n\r\n* They can get fresh authoritative persona data and much more of it.\r\n\r\n* They can keep it up to date.\r\n\r\n* They can have safe harbor.\r\n\r\n* The real power of personalization and fuller reality mining can be realized.\r\n\r\n* They have a way to conform to legal requirements.\r\n\r\n# Basic Steps and Anchor Scenarios\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n[https://github.com/LegalPhysics/ClearButton/blob/master/SequencesAndScenarios.md ](https://github.com/LegalPhysics/ClearButton/blob/master/SequencesAndScenarios.md )\r\n\r\n# System Components and Services\r\n\r\nSee: [https://github.com/LegalPhysics/ClearButton/blob/master/SystemsServices.md](https://github.com/LegalPhysics/ClearButton/blob/master/SystemsServices.md)\r\n\r\n# Data Privacy Legal Hackathon (New York)\r\n\r\nClearButton Initiative is a project http://legalhackers.org/privacyhack2014/\r\n\r\n**Approach**\r\n* Horizontal prototype, going through all the flows superficially. \r\n* Arek provides the tech overlay in addition to BL layers. \r\n\r\n**Focus:**\r\n* Business: Value Propositions\r\n* Legal: Legal Framework\r\n* Technical: Service Composition\r\n\r\n# Team\r\n\r\n## An initiative of the MIT Human Dynamics Lab, Headed by Professor Sandy Pentland.\r\n\r\n* Dazza Greenwood, MIT Media Lab\r\n* Ray Campbell, Media Lab Collaborator\r\n* Lina Kaisey, Harvard Law School/Media Lab Legal Intern\r\n* Arkadiusz Stopczynski, MIT / DTU\r\n* Thomas Hardjono.
